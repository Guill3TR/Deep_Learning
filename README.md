# Deep_Learning
Developing and applying Deep Learning models using **PyTorch, TensorFlow and Keras**:

- **Regression and Classification:** techniques for modelling and predicting numerical values and classes respectively, using neural networks and other deep learning models.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** fundamental for tasks such as image recognition, object detection and semantic segmentation.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** can capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, being especially useful in applications such as natural language processing (NLP) and text generation.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** play a crucial role in the creation of images, audio and other types of realistic synthetic data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** text comprehension and generation using advanced natural language processing techniques, including language modelling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
- **Recommender Systems:** how to use deep learning to build personalised recommender systems that anticipate and satisfy user preferences.
